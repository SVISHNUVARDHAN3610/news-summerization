Here I haven't added any weights of neural networks and datasets because of GitHub size restrictions. So, train this model on Xsum Dataset yourself's.

# 📰 News Summarization Using Transformers

A deep learning project that leverages transformer-based models like BART and T5 to generate concise and coherent summaries of lengthy news articles. This project addresses the issue of information overload by enabling fast and meaningful consumption of news content.


This project focuses on developing an advanced news summarization system using Transformer-based architectures. With the exponential growth of online news content, readers often face information overload. The aim of this project is to automatically generate concise and meaningful summaries of lengthy news articles without losing the core message.

We employed state-of-the-art transformer models such as BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) and T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) for extractive and abstractive summarization tasks. These models were fine-tuned on large-scale news datasets to understand the structure, context, and semantics of the articles. The system processes raw news input and generates human-like summaries that are coherent, fluent, and contextually accurate.
